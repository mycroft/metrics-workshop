# metrics-workshop

This little project contains some basic python code (a frontend, a backend) that will be used as a working project in which observability metrics will be added to demonstrate the purpose of adding counter, gauge & histogram metrics.

## Build & run

First, launch the backend/storage components with `docker-compose`:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
